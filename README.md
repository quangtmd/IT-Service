# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally and deploy it to the web.

## 1. Run Locally

This project consists of two main parts: a **Frontend** (React app) and a **Backend** (Node.js API server). You must run both simultaneously for the application to work correctly.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js
- A local MySQL database server installed and running. (e.g., via [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-mac/), or a direct install).

### Step 1: Database Setup (Important!)

For local development, using a local database is strongly recommended to avoid network and IP whitelisting issues with remote databases.

1.  **Start your local MySQL server.**
2.  **Create a new database.** You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or a command-line client. Name it `iq_technology_db`.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE iq_technology_db;
    ```
3.  **Import the tables.** Use the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements found in the comments at the top of the `backend/server.js` file to create the necessary tables (`Products`, `Orders`, `Articles`, `MediaItems`) inside your new database.

---

### Step 2: Backend Setup

The backend server connects to your local MySQL database and provides APIs for the frontend.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file.** Copy the example file to create your own local configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  **Configure your database connection.** Open the newly created `.env` file and update the credentials to match your local MySQL setup. (For default XAMPP/MAMP/WAMP, the user is often `root` with an empty password).

4.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`. **Keep this terminal window open.** If it connects to the database successfully, you will see a confirmation message.

---

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

In a **new, separate terminal window**, set up and run the React frontend.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory** (if you are in the `backend` directory, run `cd ..`).

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set your Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root (if it doesn't exist) and add your Gemini API key. The backend URL is handled automatically by the proxy.
    ```
    # .env file in the project's root directory
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
4.  **Run the frontend app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will now be accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`) and should be able to communicate with your local backend API.

## 2. Deploy to Render (Recommended)

This project includes a `render.yaml` blueprint file, which allows you to deploy both the frontend and backend services with a single click, preventing common configuration errors.

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  Go to the [**Render Blueprint Dashboard**](https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints) and click **New Blueprint Instance**.
3.  Connect the repository you just forked. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file.
4.  Render will prompt you to provide values for the secret environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc., and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`). Enter your credentials for your **remote/hosted** MySQL database and your Gemini API key.
5.  Click **Apply**. Render will build and deploy both the frontend and backend, automatically linking them together.
